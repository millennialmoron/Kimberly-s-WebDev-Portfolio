        <h3 class="card-title">About Me:</h3>
        <p class="card-text">From first discovering how easy and fun it was to manipulate HTML to make my MySpace the
          best looking, most badass representation of me to designing my first full-stack, fully operational React App
          this past summer has been quite the journey. In college I took a year of C++, but decided I was a lost cause
          at the subject when my programs didn't immediately work and my all male comp sci classmates didn't seem to
          like me asking questions. Math (my major) came easily to me, so I stuck with that. After college, I fiddled
          around with web development occasionally by making websites for free for some non profits I volunteered with.
          Over the years, I learned css and Flash and enjoyed the side projects, but never felt compelled to go further.
          Until this past year.</p>
        <p class="card-text">In March of this year, I decided to move forward with a career change after working in
          education for 13+ years. I signed up for a 65+ hour full stack bootcamp (online) from Udemy and began to
          actively spend 6+ hours daily learning front and back end programming and loving every second of it. When I
          finished the bootcamp, I began picking small ideas for sites and apps to build. Then, to really learn and feel
          competent, I decided to build my first full-stack react app. It's been quite a journey of learning, but I've
          loved it.</p>

                  and the DOM. It was part of a challenge, but in the end, I enjoyed the idea, added in a few new
                  details to make it more interesting for the user's experience, and simply "published" through github.

                  us create a drum kit. I liked the idea and decided I could make something similar but more along the
                  lines of a DJ synth pad. The project was fun to create, and I think the outcome is pretty amusing.</p>

                <p>This was a challenge to create an app based on the Simon Game. I really, <em>really</em> enjoyed this
                  challenge. I solved some of the problems a little differently than the teacher did in her videos, but
                  the outcome is just as functional and fun. This was probably one of my favorite challenges to solve,
                  just because I loved the logical issues that needed to be addressed.</p>

                <p>This is a very simple blog, meant to demonstrate understanding in connecting a server to a database,
                  in this case using MongoDB. I actually really enjoyed this. I haven't really used this blog much (as
                  you can tell), I'm not much of a blogger, but it was a lot of fun to create and struggle through the
                  docs, particularly since the videos I was watching were a bit outdated and the methodology in some
                  cases had changed.</p>

                  most frustrating project I worked on, primarily becasue so much of the setup had changed from the time
                  of the videos I was using to the time I was attempting the project. I did however manage to eventually
                  find solutions and get the site working correctly. I don't currently send newsletters to this list, so
                  it's not useful to me for that purpose, but it was a great learning experience and taught me a lot
                  about solution-seeking when things aren't working like they should.</p>

                <p>I built this project completely from scratch after completing my bootcamp. It took about two months
                  between work and a slight detour for Covid. Most of the project actually went rather smoothly. The
                  React components came together fairly easily and the backend logic went pretty smoothly. Things that
                  took the most time for me to complete were getting the React end and the server end to pass data back
                  and forth, and misunderstanding some docs that resulted in overcomplicating publishing the site to
                  Heroku and it not working correctly for a while.</p>
